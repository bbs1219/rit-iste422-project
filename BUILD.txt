How to generate the deployment artifact for EdgeConvert-1.0-SNAPSHOT

1. Go to https://github.com/bbs1219/rit-iste422-project and clone the repository.
	(The gradle script to build the artifact must be run within the repository)
	Clone the repository onto your machine.
	
2. Make sure you have gradle installed and updated
	The easiest way to do this on unix machines is to install zip, then install sdkman.
	Once you've installed sdkman, you can use that to install the latest version of gradle.
	If you're on windows you can use WSL to perform these steps, it worked for me. 

3. In a terminal window, navigate to the root directory of the repository on your machine.
	Type the following command:
	
	gradle jar

	The script will generate the deployment artifact in ./build/libs
